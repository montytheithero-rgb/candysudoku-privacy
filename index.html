  <h1>Privacy Policy for Candy Sudoku – Sweet Logic</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 16, 2025</p>

  <p>This game does not collect, store, or share any personal information from players.</p>

  <p>The gameplay data (such as progress, settings, and game state) is saved locally on your device only and is not transmitted to any external server.</p>

  <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. These ads are served by Google’s advertising network, which may use anonymous, non-personal information (such as device type, coarse location, or usage patterns) to deliver relevant content. This includes the use of your device’s advertising identifier for targeted advertising — a practice that Apple defines as “tracking.” No personally identifiable details (like names, emails, or passwords) are collected or shared.</p>

  <p>All in-app purchases (such as the option to remove ads) are securely handled through Apple App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android). We do not have access to your payment information or account credentials.</p>

  <p>We do not engage in behavioral profiling or data sharing with third parties beyond what is necessary for ad delivery, app functionality, and crash reporting.</p>

  <p>If you are under 13 years old, please play with the permission of a parent or guardian. The game is family-friendly and does not contain inappropriate content.</p>

  <p>By using this app, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to update this policy over time, but future changes will remain focused on user privacy and transparency.</p>
